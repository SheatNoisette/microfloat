# MicroFloat
A Fixed Point Maths Library for 8-16 bits embedded systems.
I was searching for a library capable of providing fixed point maths for really restricted systems such as 8 - 16 bits 
computers or microcontrollers but I couldn't find any that fullfil my needs: 

* Should be fully compliant with C89,
* Be platform independent,
* Use as little ram and storage as possible,
* Easy to use.

This is a work in progress. It may reach a usable state, probably.
